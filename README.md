# An Emotion Recognition Task using Psychtoolbox

This code runs an emotion recognition task using Psychtoolbox in MATLAB. It shows participants brief flashes of happy or sad faces. The task involves presenting participants with stimuli (sad vs. happy), each displayed at varying durations (50, 100, 150, and 200 ms) and with different noise levels.
During each trial, a Stimulus with randomized face emotion, noise level, and stimulus duration is presented. Participants have a 1-second window to distinguish the presented stimulus as either happy by pressing H or sad by pressing S.
After all the trials are finished, the participants' performance in different noise levels and stimulus durations are plotted.
